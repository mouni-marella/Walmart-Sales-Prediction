# Walmart-Sales-Prediction
•	Collected and preprocessed the Walmart sales dataset, applied feature engineering to introduce new columns.  Visualized the patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib followed by scaling and encoding using “Python”.
•	Tuned various regression models such as Linear, Ridge regressor, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,  and XGBoost, along with RNN algorithm - LSTM (TensorFlow). The LSTM model outperformed others with an R-squared error of “0.99”.
•	Generated a report based on data interpretations, concluding that peak sales occurred during December and January.
